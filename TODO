GNet TODO
---------

Below are features we are interested in adding.  Please see HACKING if
you can help.



Before 0.2 (first major release):

  Programming
   - More portability fixes
   - Save the iochannel in sockets and reuse it.
   - Add ref counts to structures.

  Documentation

  Other



Long term:

  Features
    - Build Debian docs package?

    - Add more error types

    - Allow non-blocking calls to be canceled (return the state?)

    - Perl-style pack and unpack functions

        These don't have to be exact clones.  There are some things I
        don't think are needed (like hexidecimal and bit strings).
        The main features should be network byte order shorts and
        longs, bytes, and padded strings.  These would be vararg
        functions and look like printf.

    - Better asynchronous DNS
      * Use pthread's instead of fork where available (or better,
	  the new Glib 1.4 threads where available)
      * Add option to use ADNS? (and update license)
      * Consider modifying glibc/BIND code?

    - Fix gnet_udp_socket_get_MTU on Solaris (If there's a demand for it)

    - Better support for multihomed systems (I'm not sure what's 
	needed)

    - gnet_inetaddr_new will give you localhost if you give it an
	hostname of "" in Linux.  Is this true on all systems?  If
	not, we should do a return-on-fail when we get an empty
	string.

    - Consider adding gnet_io_channel_{readv/writev}.  Stevens says
	this isn't Posix (yet?) - check how available it is.  We can
	always fake it if we don't have it.

    - Support IPv6

    - Include more protocols

	The goal here is to add basic implementations of popular file
	transfer protocols (eg, HTTP, FTP).  Just the basics - nothing
	fancy.

	I'm hesitant to include more complex protocols (eg, NNTP,
	SMTP, IRC) because they are more application-focused and have
	limited use outside their specific application.  For example,
	someone who wants NNTP is probably implementing a new reader
	and would be better off implementing it from scratch to get a
	finer control over the protocol.  On the other hand, if
	someone had a good implementation of NNTP with a good
	interface and there was demand for it, I would probably accept
	it.  (An alternative would be start a gnet-protocol library
	which would include more complex protocols).

	I would also be more inclined to accept implementations that
	are in existing, working programs as opposed to from-scratch
	implementations (for complex protocols).  This is because
	existing implementations have been tested both in
	functionality and in interface design.  Moreover, we would be
	guaranteed at least one user.

    - Bindings for other languages

	The GTK doc folks are working on a new standard for describing
	interfaces.  Use this when it's done.

    - Some sort of network configuration widget?

   Improvements
    - Use getnameinfo when available (for IPv6?)

   Other
    - Port, port, port!

    - More documentation and examples

	Add a beginners guide.  Show more code examples.

    - Clean up Debian packages

	They seems alright, though I'd like someone with more Debian
	experience to double check them.


Never: (things that will probably never become part of gnet)

  - Raw IP (there are other libraries)
