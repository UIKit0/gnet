/*

  config-win32.h is generated by autoconf from config-win32.h.in.
  This file is for internal use only.  It should not be #included in
  programs.

  This file should include things that would normally go into a
  config.h if we could use autoconf and config.h.in in Windows.  Note
  that you need autoconf to generate config-win32.h from
  config-win32.h.in.  We include config-win32.h in the repository to
  make the lives of Window's developers working from CVS easier.  If
  you change something in the .h file, make sure you change it in the
  .h.in file.
