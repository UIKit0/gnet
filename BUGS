* Process uses 100% CPU

On some systems GLib has problems if you use more than one watch on a
file descriptor.  The problem is GLib assumes descriptors can appear
twice in the array passed to poll(), which is true on some systems but
not others (Linux).  If GLib passes an array that's larger than than
number of open decriptors, poll fails.  This causes GLib to
immediately try again, fail, try again, and so on, looping.

One solution is to not set more than one watch per iochannel.  In many
situations this is difficult to do.  An alternative is to replace the
limited poll with an unlimited poll.  See Jungle Monkey for an example
of how to do this.

See GLib bug 11059 on http://bugs.gnome.org.  (The original bug report
is incorrect - the problem is with GLib, not Linux.)
