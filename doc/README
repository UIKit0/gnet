GNet Documentation notes


gtk-doc is required to build the documentation.  Only developers would
need to build the docs.  All distributions should include the docs
pre-built.


To build the documentation:

> make scan
> make templates

Style notes

* Arguments 

  @arg: argument argument

  - The first word is not capitalized.
  - There is no period.

  Also note:
  - Parameter names should be as descriptive as possible.  Use
    words instead of abbreviations.  E.g.:
      * "buffer" instead of "buf"
      * "length" instead of "len"

    Exceptions: "src" and "dst" are ok.


* Return values

  Returns: something.  Something else happens.

  - The first word is not capitalized
  - There is a period so that the first sentence reads as a sentence
  - There can be more than one sentence.
