.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIgnet-config\fP is a tool that is used to configure to determine
the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile
and link programs that use \fIGNet\fP. It is also used internally
to the .m4 macros for GNU autoconf that are included with \fIGNet\fP.
\fIgnet-config\fP is depricated - use \fIpkg-config\fP for new projects.

if \-\-exec\-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified
before any \-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
