GNet HACKING
------------

Information for potential GNet hackers


What to do (in general)
-----------------------

We will always accept bug and portability fixes.  If you are
interested in doing something more major, please write
gnet-dev@umich.edu first.  This is so we know what people are doing
and can offer advice.  Also see the TODO file for ideas on the
direction we want to take GNet.


Mailing list
------------

gnet-dev@umich.edu is the development mailing list.  To subscribe,
email dhelder@umich.edu and tell him to add you.  We will setup a
joinable (majordomo?) mailing list when we get around to it.


How to check out GNet anonymously
---------------------------------

  > cd <directory I want GNet to go in>
  > setenv CVSROOT :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome
  > cvs login	[there is no password, hit return if it asks]
  > cvs -z3 checkout gnet

Be warned that the repository version of GNet may be instable or may
not even compile.


How to make code contributions
------------------------------

We only accept code contributions in the form of a unified diff
against the latest released version and, preferably, the version in
CVS.  If you have added to the API, you _must_ provide complete gtkdoc
style comments in the source.
            
To make a unified diff, please follow these instructions:
   
1. Remove temporary files:
    make distclean

2. Rename your source tree:
    cd ..
    mv gnet-0.1.4 gnet-0.1.4-snazzy-feature

3. Unpack the original gnet library source alongside it:
    tar zxf /tmp/gnet-0.1.4.tar.gz

4. Generate the diffs:
   diff -urNb gnet-0.1.4 gnet-0.1.4-snazzy-feature > /tmp/gnet.patch

5. Check the patch and remove any unnecessary patches from the file.

6. If you've added several features, it's best to send them as
   several independent patches if you can.

7. Don't forget to add your name and email address to AUTHORS so that
   you assert copyright over GNet and help to keep GNet free!


If you have just patched one or two files, then making patches is even
easier. For each file, just do:
cp file.c file.c.orig
Make changes to file.c ...
diff -u file.c.orig file.c > /tmp/file.c.patch

and just send us the patch: /tmp/file.c.patch.
