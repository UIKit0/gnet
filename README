GNet README
-----------

GNet is a simple network library.  It is writen in C, object-oriented,
and built upon glib.  It is intended to be small, fast, easy-to-use,
and easy to port.  GNet comes with documentation and examples.  The
interface is similar to the interface for Java's network library.  It
is licensed under the GNU Library General Public Licence.

Features:
  * TCP 'client' sockets
  * TCP 'server' sockets
  * UDP
  * IP Multicast
  * Internet address abstraction
  * Non-blocking TCP sockets and address lookup

GNet requires Glib 1.2.  You can get this at www.gtk.org.  Or, if you
have a system with packages (eg, Red Hat or Debian), look for the
latest glib package.

GNet is BETA software.  Most of the functions have been tested (in the
examples programs and in Jungle Monkey), but there may still be some
bugs.  There will be a stable release probably by Spring.  Help is
always welcome.  Check-out the TODO file too.

Bug reports should be submited through http://bugs.gnome.org.  
  (see http://bugs.gnome.org/Reporting.html)

Pending bugs can be viewed at http://bugs.gnome.org/db/pa/lgnet.html

Comments and questions should be sent to gnet-dev@umich.edu.
