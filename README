GNet README
-----------

GNet is a simple network library.  It is writen in C, object-oriented,
and built upon glib.  It is intended to be small, fast, easy-to-use,
and easy to port.  GNet comes with documentation and examples.  It is
licensed under the GNU Library General Public Licence.

Features:
  * TCP 'client' sockets
  * TCP 'server' sockets
  * UDP
  * IP Multicast
  * Internet address abstraction
  * Asynchronous socket IO
  * Asynchronous DNS lookup
  * Byte packing and unpacking
  * URLs (Experimental)
  * Server and Conn objects (Experimental)

GNet has been ported to Linux, *BSD, Solaris, HP, and Windows.  It may
work on other operating systems also.

GNet requires Glib 1.2.  You can get this at www.gtk.org.  Or, if you
have a system with packages (eg, Red Hat or Debian), look for the
latest glib package.

Comments and questions should be sent to gnet-dev@eecs.umich.edu.

Developer info
==============

API documentation lives on the GNet homepage (specifically, at
http://www.gnetlibrary.org//docs)

The URL, Server, and Conn modules are experimental and part of the
IOChannel module is also experimental.  The GNet development team
believes these modules are useful and usable, but are not yet
completely confident in them.  The API to these modules may change and
there may still be bugs in them.  For example, the URL module is
incomplete and the new IOChannel functions should be audited again.
If you are feeling adventurous and want to use these functions, define
GNET_EXPERIMENTAL.  Otherwise, your compiler should warn or fail if
they are used.  We welcome bug fixes, improvements, and comments on
the experimental modules.  Our hope is that adventurous programmers
will use these modules and help in their further development.


Hacking
=======

License
=======

Read COPYING for information on the license.  GNet is under the GNU
