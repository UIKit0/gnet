GNet README
-----------

GNet is a simple network library.  It is writen in C, object-oriented,
and built upon glib.  It is intended to be small, fast, easy-to-use,
and easy to port.  GNet comes with documentation and examples.  The
interface is similar to the interface for Java's network library.  It
is licensed under the GNU Library General Public Licence.

Features:
  * TCP 'client' sockets
  * TCP 'server' sockets
  * UDP
  * IP Multicast
  * Internet address abstraction
  * Non-blocking TCP sockets and address lookup

GNet has been ported to Linux, *BSD, Solaris, and HP.  It may work on
other flavors of Unix too.  Part of GNet has been ported to Windows.

GNet requires Glib 1.2.  You can get this at www.gtk.org.  Or, if you
have a system with packages (eg, Red Hat or Debian), look for the
latest glib package.
