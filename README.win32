          *** IMPORTANT *** 

This is a CVS snapshot of GNet.
This snapshot was compiled with development GNet code.
The pack/unpack funtions are the only 1.2 code that has been 
tested an exported.

This requires GLib 1.3 snapshot 20010301.
[http://www.gimp.org/win32/glib-dev-20010301.zip]
That glib snapshot has two confirmed problems:
1) glib's socket iochannels are not freed properly,
which causes Winsock to run out of buffer space over time.
2) glib's window handle callback code always calls back,
GNet in this release ignores those extra callbacks.

Later versions of Glib 1.3.X may work too.

GNet README for Win32
---------------------

This document contains
 - General Win32 Specific Information
 - MINGW/GCC & CYGWIN Notes
 - MSVC 6.0 Notes
 - HACKING/TODO on Win32


General Win32 Specific Information
----------------------------------

The Windows port requires either Windows 95 (with the Winsock2 patch)
or better, or Windows NT (with Service Pack 4) or better. 

gnet_inetaddr_gethostname() can't handle hostnames over 256 chars.

gnet_private_inetaddr_list_interfaces() does not support more than 10
interfaces.

MINGW/GCC & CYGWIN Notes
------------------------

Compiling GNet on windows with gcc/mingw is supported. You first need to patch 
w32api up to version 0.5 or later. [see http://mingw.sourceforge.net/] 
A makefile to build GNet is included in the zip.

You can use/link GNet with gcc/mingw. A ".a" is included in the zip.
A makefile is provided to compile the example programs.

When compiling your program use the "-lws2_32 switch"
example:
gcc -g -Wall -mno-cygwin -mpentium -fnative-struct -I../glib -I. -I../gnet 
-L../glib -L../gnet hostinfo.c -o hostinfo -lgnet-1.0 -lglib-1.3 -lws2_32

MSVC 6.0 Notes
--------------

How to link your project to the Gnet DLL uing MSVC 6.0:
Download the latest version of Glib for Win32 and copy the header
files and glib-X.Y.dll and glib-X.Y.lib to the gnet project folder. Do
the same for GNet. Remember change your project settings to include
glib-X.Y.lib gnet-X.Y.lib in the link tab.

How to compile GNet with MSVC 6.0:
Download the latest version of Glib for Win32 and copy the header
files and glib-X.Y.dll and glib-X.Y.lib to your project folder.
Download the latest version of Gnet for Win32 and a .dsp file is 
provided to build the project.


HACKING/TODO on Win32
---------------------

For a general description on how GNet for Win32 was implemented see
halfway down gnet-private.c.

FIX: gnet_inetaddr_gethostname() so it can handle hostnames over 256 chars.

FIX: gnet_private_inetaddr_list_interfaces() so it support more than
10 Interfaces.
