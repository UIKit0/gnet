                     GNetXmlRpc server and client
                  XMLRPC functionality using GLib/GNet

   BACKGROUND

   I built this library for a scientific gtk display application in which
   I am generating date in one process, and would like to display it in
   another process. Through this library, whenever the data is ready for
   display, I can easily send it to the display program.

   For this application it was enough to support one string in and one
   string out subset of the full XMLRPC application. If someone is
   interested it would be easy to add a parallell callback functionality
   for the full XML data. I doubt that I will get around to doing it though.

   See the two example programs test-xml-server and test-xml-client for
   examples how to use this library.

   TODO

   - Ideally, GnetXmlRpcClient would be built on top of GConnHttp and
     GnetXMLRcpServer would be built on top of a still-to-write GServerHttp
     (= provide asynchronous client functionality, HTTP authentication would
     then be handled by GServerHttp)

   - XML escaping/unescaping should be done using GLib's g_markup_*
     family of functions.

   - XML parsing should be done using GMarkupParser (any non-UTF8 input would
     need to be converted to UTF8 first).

   - Support other types than just strings / add full xml parameter support

   - By default block connections from servers other than localhost (IP filter)

   - Add option to accept connections from a wild card of servers.

   - When registering commands, check if they already exist and free
     the corresponding resources.

   - When destroying a server, destroy the command table hash.

   - Better error handling.

   - Make it part of GNet? (needs all of the above fixed + a decent API)
