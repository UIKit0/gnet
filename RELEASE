Creating the release tarball:
 - update NEWS
 - do 'make distcheck'
 - make sure the created tarball really includes the HTML docs
   (try 'make dist' if not)
 - run 'grep ss_family src/*.c' - there should be no results; if there are
   any, use the GNET_SOCKADDR_FAMILY macro instead.
   

Adding new source files:
 - add to GNET.DSP
 - add to src/Makefile.am
 - add to src/makefile.mingw

Adding new API:
 - add to gnet.def
 - make sure GNET_INTERFACE_AGE in
   configure.ac is set to 0
