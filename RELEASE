Creating the release tarball:
 - update debian/changelog
 - do 'make distcheck'
 - make sure the created tarball
   really incnludes the HTML docs
   (try 'make dist' if not)
 - run 'grep ss_family src/*.c' - there should
   be no results; if there are any, use the
   GNET_SOCKADDR_FAMILY macro instead.
   

Adding new source files:
 - add to GNET.DSP
 - add to src/Makefile.am
 - add to src/makefile.mingw

Adding new API:
